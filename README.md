# norl
This is repo for my "Responsive Website Development and Design Specialization" Capstone project called "North Life" or "norl" (for short) by University of London on Coursera. 

This is the final code for week 1 of programming (and week 5 of the capstone project). It thas basic page structure, with sober CSS, MongoDB interactions and user can modify data. User inputs and date wise filtering of todos is something I want to focus on in the next week.

create a new meteor project and replace everything other than .meteor folder with these files or download the zip file, unzip it and you're ready to go.
